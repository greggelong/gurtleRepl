# gurtleRepl
a simple read, evaluate, print loop interface in the browser for my p5js turtle


(need to get this done, why procrastinate?)
work to be done:
- [ ] clear turtle and reset turtle
- [ ] clear code
- [ ] build in loop structure; need a variable to keep track of the code index and if hit loop send to loop function look for end loop and repeat that the number of times then move the code index to the point
after the the end loop.

- [ ] try and have user defined functions for recursion
- [ ] write some documentation on toy language
